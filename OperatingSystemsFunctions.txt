One function of the operating system is administering security. The operating system uses users and groups to restrict access to files, applications, system resources, and configuration settings. Each user has a unique username and password that identifies them to the operating system. Then based on the user the operating system makes decisions about what actions and resources a user can perform or access.

Another operating system function is providing a user interface. There are two types of user interfaces, graphical and command line. The command line uses a text-based interface, the graphical user interface provides the desktop environment for launching programs and managing the system. The command line interface is more common for technical users and the graphical interface is designed for the average user.

A third operating system function is establishing an Internet connection. The operating system uses a network adapter to establish a wired connection connected to a DSL modem or a cable, or the operating system may connect using wireless WiFi or Bluetooth to a mobile broadband or satellite service. The operating system may also provide a web browser or email program to access services once the Internet connection is active.
