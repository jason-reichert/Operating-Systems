One function of the operating system is administering security. The operating system uses users and groups to restrict access to files, applications, system resources, and configuation settings. Each user has a unique username and password that identifies them to the operating system. Then based on the user the operating system makes decisions about what actions and resources a user can perform or access.

Another operating system function is providing a user interface. There are two types of user interfaces, graphical and command line. The command line uses a text based interface, the graphical user interface provides the desktop environment for launching programs and managing the system. The command line interface is more common for technical users and the graphical interface is designed for the avergage user.
